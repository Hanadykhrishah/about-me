# about-me
  1-I am Createing a “Top Ten” at the bottom of my HTML page as an ordered list in HTML.

  2-I am Converting my work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML.

  3-I Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
  Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
  and It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
  After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer.

  4- I Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array. And Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.

  5-Then Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end i will tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
